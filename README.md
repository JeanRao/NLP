## Word embedding
in this section, I expored 2 ways of doing word embedding. The primitive way of using one hot encoding is not discussed here.
### Count based SVD method 
This method will get informative word embedding, but it cannot handle large word vocabulary
### Predictive method 
This method can handle harge vocabulary, but different choice of hyperparameter setting for word embedding model will lead to defferent results.
## Classification
In this section, I used multiple models to solve classification problems regarding NLP
## Identifying a person's MBTI personality type
The dataset is downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/mbti-type. I used RNN with LSTM to predict a person's MBTI personality type based on his or her post at Reddit forum.
